Texas Hold'em Monte Carlo Poker Simulator

Project Overview
This project simulates Texas Hold'em poker hands to estimate the probabilities of winning, tying, or losing for a given user hand. It uses Monte Carlo simulation and hand evaluation logic to analyze outcomes against multiple opponents. The notebook also visualizes the distribution of possible hands the user can have after each stage of the game (Flop, Turn).

Features:

	1. Evaluates all standard poker hands: High Card, One Pair, Two Pair, Three of a Kind, Straight, Flush, Full House, Four of a Kind, Straight Flush, Royal Flush.

	2. Monte Carlo simulation of thousands of games to estimate win, tie, and loss probabilities.

	3. Visualizes user hand distribution using bar charts.

	4. Supports input of known community cards (Flop, Turn) and any number of opponents.

	5. Calculates 95% confidence intervals for win/tie probabilities.
